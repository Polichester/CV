CV Ramon Martinez

My CV is focused on IT companies. Inside my CV we can find some description of myself together with my profile picture. We can also find some sections about my competences together with my experiences and professional goals. I have chosen three colours, black, white and green, as they are my favourite colours and I find that they go very well together.
